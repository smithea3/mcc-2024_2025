<div class="para">This will be said quite a few times in this section, but the results of the tests developed in this section DO NOT give the value to which a series converges. It is like a test you might take a doctorâ€™s office. For example, you might go to the doctor feeling under the weather and they test you for the flu. The test says you are positive for the flu, but the test does not tell you which specific strand of the flu you have. Testing for convergence is nearly the same idea: the test will determine if it converges, but it will not tell you the value to which it converges. For that, the idea of a <dfn class="terminology">power series</dfn> is needed.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_integral-test.html#remark_test-of-convergence-does-not-give-value" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
