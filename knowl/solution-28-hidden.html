<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><div class="para">It is good to stop and take note that the summand looks a lot like a geometric series, especially if the denominator did not have the plus four in it. Also, it is true that <span class="process-math">\(18^k &lt; 4+18^k\text{,}\)</span> which implies that <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \frac{1}{4+18^k} &lt; \frac{1}{18^k}\text{.}\)</span> Since the series <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{18^k}\)</span> is geometric and the common ratio is less than one and <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{4+18^k} &lt; \sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{18^k}\)</span> it can be concluded that the given series must also converge by the Direct Comparison Test.</div></div></body>
