<div class="para">To quickly review the concept of a factorial, consider the following scenario. You want to create a playlist of song. You have 10 songs from which to choose. How many different lists can you make if you cannot repeat songs on the playlist and the order of the playlist is important. Since you can choose from any of the 10 songs from the first choice, but only nine for the second, eight for the third, seven for the fourth, etc., you would calculate the total by multiplying these choices together.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdots2\cdot1=3,628,800
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">We condense this expression by writing <span class="process-math">\(10!\text{,}\)</span> which we read aloud as "10 factorial."</div>
